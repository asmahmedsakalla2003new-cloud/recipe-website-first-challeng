## My Process

### Built With

- HTML5 semantic markup
- CSS custom properties (variables)
- CSS Flexbox and Grid
- Media Queries for responsive design
- Custom fonts (`ElMessiri` and `Poppins`)
- Box shadows, border-radius, and decorative lines for styling

### What I Learned

- How to use **@font-face** to include custom fonts locally.  
- Creating **decorative lines under headings** with `::after`.  
- Styling **responsive tables** and making them stack vertically on small screens.  
- Using CSS **variables** for a consistent color palette.  
- Applying **flexbox and grid** for layout and centering content.  

### Continued Development

- Add **interactive features**, like ingredient checkboxes.  
- Enhance **accessibility** for users with screen readers.  
- Optimize for **faster load times** and smaller font files.  
- Add more **recipes dynamically** using JavaScript or a backend.
